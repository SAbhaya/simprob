# Introduction

This is to explain some very simple probability & statistics. Most of you already know these things. So this is for absolute beginers.

# Basic probablity

Lets assume simple coin. It has a two faces and if you flip the coin it will give  result either **HEAD** or **TAIL**

So probablity of result HEAD is 0.5 or 1/2 and probablity of result TAIL is 0.5 or 1/2

Lets assue we flip the coin 10 times. We can use R to simulate the results.

1. we create the coin & assing 0 & 1 (for HEAD & TAIL)

```{r}
coin <- c(0,1)

```
2. flip the coin 10 times and store the results in **result** 

```{r}
result <- sample(coin,10, replace = TRUE)

```
Lets see the result

```{r}
result
```
Histrogram of this restuls as precentage of each occurance

```{r}
library(lattice)
histogram(result)

```
## Probability Density Function
The Probability Dessity Fucntion is 

```{r}
densityplot(result)
```
