## Tossing a coin

The probababilty of perticuar event can be described as:

> - [ ] add equation


The probability of the coin landing H or HEAD is ½ [1]

And the probability of the coin landing T or TAIL is ½

Probability is Just a Guide
Probability does not tell us exactly what will happen, it is just a guide

Example: toss a coin 100 times, how many Heads will come up?
Probability says that heads have a ½ chance, so we can expect 50 Heads.
But when we actually try it we might get 48 heads, or 55 heads ... or anything really, but in most cases it will be a number near 50.

Probability is the chance that something will happen
The probability of an event occurring is somewhere between impossible and certain.

As well as words, we can use numbers (such as fractions or decimals) to show the probability of something happening:

* Impossible is zero
* Certain is one.

Between 0 and 1
> * The probability of an event will not be less than 0. 
>   This is because 0 is impossible (sure that something will not happen).
> * The probability of an event will not be more than 1. 
>   This is because 1 is certain that something will happen.
